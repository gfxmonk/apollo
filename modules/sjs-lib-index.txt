@lib     Oni Apollo 'unstable' Standard Module Library
@summary Standard collection of modules for client and server-side stratified programming with 
         [Oni Apollo](http://onilabs.com/apollo)
@desc
    This Library is the standard collection of modules
    accompanying [Oni Apollo](http://onilabs.com/apollo).

    The Library is still under heavy development - the module content
    and organization of modules might change from one release to the
    next. Some of the more stable and fundamental modules include:

    * [sequence::]: Constructs for manipulating arrays, string and streams
    * [http::]: Functions for performing HTTP requests and working with URLs
    * [cutil::]: Functions and constructs for concurrent stratified programming


    ### Loading Standard Library Modules

    You can load modules from the Library by using the builtin `sjs:` scheme, e.g.:

        var http = require(sjs:http');

    By default, the `sjs:` scheme resolves to

        http:// [Path where 'oni-apollo.js' was loaded from] /modules/

    on the client-side, and to 

        file:// [Path to 'apollo' executable] /modules/

    on the server.

    If you want to serve the Library from a different location, you can set
    up a *hub redirect*; e.g. to mirror the Library on your own server:

        require.hubs.unshift(["sjs:",
                              "http://mydomain.com/apollo-mirror/"]);

        // all modules addressed as sjs:' will now be loaded from
        // the location above.
